Badgers_sports_android
======================

I've decided to open source my Android app. It's to keep up with the Wisconsin Badgers sports team. The app can be downloaded from Google Play here:
  *https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.studionice.wisco
  
This app was made with Phonegap Build. Meaning the source is HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

 * Slide-out menu with the three-lines like the modern google apps.
 * Colors follow the design guidelines.
 * Google's "roboto" fonts.
 * Functioning "back" button (rare in Phonegap apps).
 * Components of a "card" UI.
 * Hardware accelerated CSS 3 animations (So NO lag)
 * Fully customizable.
 * Partially Commented.
 * Seriously, this looks and acts native.

.


To understand some of the code I have in here, you will need to know:
 * Font awesome: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
 * Transit JS: http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/
 * Jquery
 * JQuery Mobile
 * Phonegap API


.


If you have any problem figuring something out, shoot me an email at mitch@mitchs.co.

I also have the skeleton code (No Wisconsin colors/items) available on Github. Click my profile to find it.
